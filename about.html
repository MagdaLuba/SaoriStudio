                <h2> SAORI Weaving: A Free-Style Art of Creativity and Inclusion</h2> 
                <p>SAORI is a Japanese form of free-style hand weaving with no rules and restrictions. This encourages experimentation, creativity and self-expression. It was founded by Misao Jo in the 1960s and has since spread all over the World. Misao Jo’s son, Kenzo Jo, has developed a suite of amazing floorlooms and equipment, which are designed to make weaving accessible to all, with age, experience, ability or disability no barrier.

    There are currently 4 registered SAORI studios in the UK. Each studio is run by an instructor who has trained at the SAORI headquarters in Osaka, Japan and has been authorised to teach SAORI weaving and supply SAORI looms and equipment. SAORI registered instructors understand and fully embrace the SAORI philosophy.
    
    Although each studio is completely independent and has it’s own character and areas of expertise, they have joined together to form SAORI uk and regularly come together for textile events.
    
    We are united in spreading the Joy of SAORI weaving</p>

        <h2> Saori Principles</h2>
                <h2>The Difference Between Humans and Machines</h2>

                frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                 <P>The first principle of SAORI is “Consider the difference between human and machine.” While a loom is a machine, two people using the same loom can create entirely unique pieces. Machines follow fixed instructions, but humans interpret and create based on their individual experiences.
                     Though machines now operate with minimal human input, the charm of handmade, imperfect items remains. SAORI weaving embraces human creativity, encouraging individuality and spontaneity. Each piece is a reflection of its maker in that moment—impossible to replicate. This is the beauty of imperfection and the essence of SAORI.

                <h2>Embracing Boldness in SAORI Weaving: Freedom from Perfection</h2>
                <p>While weaving may not seem risky, the fear of creating without rules can feel intimidating. Many worry about making mistakes or not being "good enough." As someone who has struggled with perfectionism, I’ve found that free-form arts like SAORI help break this mindset.SAORI weaving welcomes everyone—there’s no such thing as a "creative" or "uncreative" person. Unlike traditional crafts that require extensive skill and investment, SAORI is easy to start, with looms available at workshops. There are no limits on materials—feathers, fabric scraps, or even paper can be woven in, making each piece unique.
                    In SAORI, mistakes don’t exist, and the only rule is to be bold. Why not embrace adventure in your weaving.</p>
                    <p>Where to go next: learn about the concept of “wearable art”.
                    <img src="photos/saori cloth2.jpg" alt="Saori clothes>"> Clothes made using SAORI woven cloth are unique and beautiful. They reflect the personality of the maker and are art pieces in their own right. They look stunning, whether worn, hung over a chair, on a hanger or on the wall!.</p>

                <h2>The Joy of SAORI Weaving: Seeing with Shining Eyes.</h2>
                <p> The third principle of SAORI weaving, Look out through eyes that shine, encourages us to center joy in our creative process. True beauty isn’t found in perfection but in the moments that inspire us—laughter, nature, or simple discoveries. In weaving, as in life, imperfections add character and meaning. By embracing spontaneity and finding beauty in the unexpected, we open ourselves to creativity with curiosity and gratitude. Let go of perfection, seek joy, and weave with eyes that shine.</p>

                <h2>Inspire Each Other: The Community of SAORI Weaving</h2>

                <p>SAORI weaving is more than a craft—it’s a global community. Rooted in connection and shared creativity, this final principle reminds us that weaving links us not only to each other but to generations of artisans before us. By sharing our work, learning from others, and embracing new ideas, we create a space where inspiration flows freely. Whether in workshops or across cultures, SAORI unites people of all ages and backgrounds, proving that creativity knows no boundaries.</p>
