    <h2> SAORI Taster Session</h2>
    <p>A Taster session is a great introduction to SAORI weaving. You will be shown how to use the loom and a few simple techniques. At the end of the session you will come away with a beautiful and unique piece of cloth, enough to make a small wallhanging, panel for cushion or table runner.
        Cost £40 all materials included in price.
        A lovely idea for a gift and we can supply gift vouchers.
        We can also provide bespoke Taster sessions for groups of friends, hen parties, leaving parties etc at a time and date to suit you.

    <h2>SAORI Weaving Beginner’s Course</h2>
    <p>The SAORI Weaving Beginner’s Course is a comprehensive two-day immersion in SAORI Weaving. It is a retreat, a treat and two days of play with SAORI looms, techniques, yarns and equipment. On the first day, you will be introduced to the four principles of SAORI weaving, the loom and a range of simple and slightly less simple techniques to give your weaving texture and unique character. Your instructor will facilitate and support each student individually, introducing and demonstrating new techniques, only when you are ready and confident. For this reason we keep numbers to a maximum of 4 students.
        On the second day you will have the choice of continuing with your weaving from the previous day or starting a new piece, using the first as a sample to remind you of the techniques already introduced. You will be encouraged to experiment and channel your inner creativity with your new toolbox of SAORI techniques and with your instructor there to support and encourage, whenever required.
        You will have a choice of beautiful SAORI cotton yarns to create your own unique palette and other ‘treasures’ to add extra interest. You may also choose to bring some items from home to add to your weaving eg ribbons, fabric offcuts, buttons, beads, yarns etc. Almost anything in fact! We embrace the ‘what if’ curiosity of your inner child!
        At the end of the course, you will have nourished your creative spirit, learned some new skills, created a beautiful piece of cloth (or several) and inspired as well as been inspired by the others in your group. 
        Cost: £180 includes use of loom, instruction and materials plus refreshments (hot/cold lunch can be purchased in any of the local cafes, Waitrose, Tesco or Aldi.)
